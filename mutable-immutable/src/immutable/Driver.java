/*
 * immutable object are objects whose fields cannot be modified after they are
 * declared i.e. the values assigned to the variables cannot be modified
 * Rules to create immutable objects
 *1. Don't write setters for all the fields .(make all fields private)
 *2. write all arg constructors
 *3. make class final
 *4. use deep clone for mutable fields
 *5. use deep clone for mutable fields in getters.
 *6.make all fields final/ optional
